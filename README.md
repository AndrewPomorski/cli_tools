# Python Commmand Line Tools.

This is a repo for tools that I've written at work to simplify some everyday boring, repeatable tasks.
Every file has a simple description of it's functionality, so feel free to explore.


## How to use

What I usually do is create a directory to store the files.

```

$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/python_tools/

```

Then simply add alias to the ~/.bashrc 

```

$ sudo echo "alias your_desired_name="/usr/local/bin/python_tools/script_name.py"" >> ~/.bashrc

``` 

And that's pretty much it. Feel free to do whatever you like with the code.
