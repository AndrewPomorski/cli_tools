# Python Commmand Line Tools.

This repo is called python_tools, but not **all** of them are made with Python. Some of them are written in different languages,
That I've found are better / easier to write for the task I was trying to accomplish, so some of them might be written in Nodejs (for web stuff obviously)  / C++ / Lua etc  

I've written these tools to simplify some everyday boring, repeatable tasks I do at work or with my hobby projects.
Every file has a simple description of it's functionality, so feel free to explore.


## How to use

What I usually do is create a directory to store the files.

```

$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/python_tools/

```

Then simply add alias to the ~/.bashrc 

```

$ sudo echo "alias your_desired_name="/usr/local/bin/python_tools/script_name.py"" >> ~/.bashrc

``` 

And that's pretty much it. Feel free to do whatever you like with the code.
