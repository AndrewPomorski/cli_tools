# Command Line Utility Tools.

This is a collection of scripts and tools I wrote over time out of boredom, laziness or to try and simplify some everyday boring, repeatable tasks I do at work or with my hobby projects.
Every file has a simple description of it's functionality and usage, so feel free to explore.


## How to use

What I usually do is create a directory to store the files.

```

$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/python_tools/

```

Then simply add alias to the ~/.bashrc 

```

$ echo "alias <command_name>="/usr/local/bin/python_tools/script_name.py"" >> ~/.bashrc

``` 

For bash scripts, I just copy them to ```/usr/local/bin``` since it's already in $PATH


And that's pretty much it. Feel free to do whatever you like with the code.
